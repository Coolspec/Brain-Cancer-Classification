# Brain-Cancer-Classification
Deep learning model that can classify brain tumors into 3 categories: Meningioma, Pituitary, or Glioma.
The aim of this project was to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify brain tumors into three categories: Meningioma, Pituitary, or Glioma. 
I used Resnet50 as a pre-trained model and fine-tuned it on a dataset of MRI images of brain tumors. 
The model achieved a high accuracy of 97.5% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness for this task.
